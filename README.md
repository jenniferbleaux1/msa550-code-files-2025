# 📘 MSA 550 Code Files (Fall 2025)

Welcome to the official code repository for **MSA 550 – Predictive Analytics (Fall 2025)**.  
After each lecture, I will push updated **Jupyter notebooks** and **example code** here.

This repository is **read-only for students**:
- Clone once.
- Run `git pull` after each class to get the latest files.
- Do **not** push here. Submissions go to your **GitHub Classroom** repos.


## 🧭 Notebooks
_Auto-generated from files under `notebooks/`. Do not edit between the markers._

## 📂 What’s inside
- 🐍 Python Introduction / Refresh
- 📑 Weekly code files (Lecture 01, Lecture 02, …)
- 🔄 Live-demo updates from class

_Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder. The index below updates automatically._

## 🛠️ How to use this repository

### First time (clone)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/msa550-code-files-2025.git
cd msa550-code-files-2025
```

### After each class (pull updates)
```bash
git pull
```

### Where should I do my own work?
Do not edit files in this repo if you plan to pull updates. Use:
- Your **GitHub Classroom** assignment repos for graded work, or
- A **separate personal repo/local folder** to experiment.

If you edited a file here and `git pull` complains, see “Keeping your local changes”.

## 🔧 Keeping your local changes

### Option 1 — Stash, pull, re-apply
```bash
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
```

### Option 2 — Discard your local change to a file
```bash
git checkout -- path/to/notebook.ipynb
git pull
```

### Option 3 — Copy your version elsewhere
Move your edited notebook to another folder (e.g., `my-work/`) or to a Classroom repo.

## 🧪 Environment & data notes
- These are standard `.ipynb` files and render on GitHub.
- We avoid large datasets in this repo; small samples may appear under `data/`.
- If a notebook expects data, we’ll include a small sample or link to a public source.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### `git pull` says you have local changes
- Stash or discard the change (see “Keeping your local changes”).

### Conflicts after pulling
- You edited a file that I also changed. Resolve the conflict or keep one version.
- To avoid conflicts, keep your editable copies elsewhere.

## 📣 Contact & updates
I will announce major code updates in Brightspace.  
If something’s missing or broken here, let me know in class or by email.

Remember: **Clone once. Pull often. Don’t push here. Use Classroom for submissions.**
